To start the API and frontend services, navigate to the root directory of the project (movie-world) and run the following command in your terminal:

docker-compose up -d --build

This will build the necessary Docker images and start the containers in detached mode.

Once the setup is complete:

The frontend will be accessible at: http://localhost:3000

All API requests will be handled by the backend at: http://localhost:8000
